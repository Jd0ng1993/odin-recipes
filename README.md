README DOCUMENT FOR ODIN RECIPES WEBSITE
This is the first project I have done for The Odin Project. The goal is to create a minimalist website with different recipes on different webpages. Also the goal is to showcase different skills
that I have learned so far such as using git and github.
GOALS
1)Create a four page website. A welcome page and three recipes
2)Include pictures of recipes
3)Use git to constantly update github repository with commits
4)Update this document everytime a commit is detailing when that commit happens and what it was
5)AAR at end of project to go over goals and write down lessons learned
6)Add at the bottom of this document an acutal Readme about the website
